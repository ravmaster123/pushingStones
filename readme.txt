Welcome to Pushing Stones!

For the best gaming experience, please change you Ed into dark mode, which can be found in the setting---appearance.

To run the game, run the file main.py by typing the following into the terminal: "python3 main.py"
The terminal size can be adjusted accordingly by the user if they wish by dragging the window up and down. 
Note: The game is alot more fun if you play it with two people :)

Hope you enjoy!
